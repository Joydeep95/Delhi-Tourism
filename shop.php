<div id="intro"><b>Delhi encompasses a major part of India’s history in its evergreen monuments. This one face of Delhi wants you to know more about the city’s past. But this capital city not only enshrines a remarkable history but also flourishes in the beauty of the present! While walking inside the majestic Red Fort, me and my friends could imagine how the paths that we were taking now would have been walked by the kings and their ministers in the remote past. While taking a stroll around the passage from Lahori Gate in Red Fort, small handicrafts shops seemed enticing to us and that was a reminder that we cannot miss the amazing local markets of Delhi which are a perfect amalgamation of a variety of people, authentic food and current fashion trends that too without a pinch in the pocket. So if you have travel plans for Delhi and you wish to savor the ‘beauty of its present’ then do squeeze in the five most amazing and ‘fairly cheap’ places to shop in Delhi.</b></div><br>

<div id="text">JANPATH<br>

Janpath Market is situated opposite the famous Connaught Place, in New Delhi. This market is a mix of fixed small shops and local stalls. Here you’ll find the latest fashion goods all decorated in the pomp and glory of their arrival, embellishing the entire market. Other than the fixed small shops and local stalls, there are also local cloth/Mojari or Jutti (a Punjabi or Rajisthani footwear)/purse and other handicraft artisans sitting between the lanes of fixed shops. Their embroidered stuff is amazing. Their products are mostly traditional but worth souvenirs to be stored in your backpack in case you want to keep a piece of the ‘trendy Delhi’ with you.   There is one thing that should be kept in mind is that there is no limit to bargain here. The more interested you are in a good the better bargain tactics you should behold to be the proud owner of the goods! Prices sometime fall beyond the half of the ‘fixed prices’ set by the shopkeepers. From a budget traveler to foreign tourists to the people of Delhi, you’ll find all kinds of people there and it amusing to see them bargain with the shopkeepers and come out victorious with bags filled with fairly cheap yet fashionable stuff.

<div id="text">KHARI BAOLI<br>

Want to have a full sensory experience of color, texture, smell and taste of Delhi? Want to know Delhi’s history, culture and cuisine through its spices? Welcome to the biggest wholesale spice market in the world, on a street of Delhi called Khari Baoli.

History says that the spice market in Delhi started in the 17th century and has continued till date! This market is situated around Fatehpuri Masjid which was built in the year 1650 by Fatehpuri Begum, one of the wives of Shah Jahan. The name, Khari Baoli, has certain significance here – Baoli means a step well whereas Khari or Khara means salty. It was therefore a salty water step well used for bathing and for animals. But, that is history now, because none of them exist and it is here that the market stands. As you walk along the Khari Baoli Street, look here and there and notice a trade worth billions happening but it happens through shops which located in small alleys and bylanes which are hardly a meter wide.

The market is as good as a spice den! From local to exotic spices, you’ll find it all here and that too in reasonable prices. The wind blowing over the Streets of Khari Baoli carry along with them a beautiful smell of these rich spices and suddenly you feel the flavor of Delhi standing amidst cramped lanes and tightly wreathed shops. It was only after watching the film ‘Mistress of Spices’ that I was excited to explore this flavorful street. Popularly it is a hub of spices but you’ll also find sweet and dry fruit shops all around the corner ready to fill you way beyond your stomach can bear but the taste buds just can’t get off the amazing flavor of these small yet filling snacks. Also Ayurvedic herbs and medicines are available here. They will appear to as fossils but are actually rare herbs and medicines which are actually very good remedies for certain diseases.

Khari Baoli was certainly unlike the other fashion streets of Delhi but in case you want to take away packets of spices wrapped in silver airtight foil bags just so you could enrich your journey with India’s culture and flavor then this is your place. Come. Taste. Explore.

<br>Timings: Monday- Saturday, 10.30am- 7.30pm</div><br>
<div id="text">SAROJINI NAGAR MARKET<br>

Sarojini Nagar Market is located in South West Delhi, near Safdarjung Airport. At the Sarojini Nagar Market you get fashionable clothes at affordable prices. Export-surplus garments as well as rejected export clothing come to this market at throwaway prices. That is why product of even reputed brands available here at cheap prices. But don't expect trial or changing rooms at street-side shops. Besides, use your art of haggling. A lot of small stalls/shops are cramped together and you’ll find this market bustling with people, but don’t nudge yourself from getting into the market because it surely is a fair deal to get good stuff in less than half of its price.

<div id="text">HANUMAN MANDIR, CHUDI (BANGLE) BAZAAR, C.P<br>

Hanuman Temple in Connaught Place, New Delhi, is an ancient Hindu temple and is claimed to be one of the five temples of Mahabharata days in Delhi.

In case you visit this temple to taste a little bit of its divinity then don’t forget to taste a little bit of its decorative bangles. The temple timings are 5am- 11pm everyday but the main darshan doors are closed in the afternoon from 1pm-3pm. But the temple is open and so is the Bangle Bazaar within the vicinity of the temple.

The small commercial establishments around the temple are decorated with bangles in resplendent colors. All kinds of bangles are available in this bazaar. Lac, plastic, glass and metal bangles adorn the tiny little shops. From trendy funky to traditional, from gaudy to simple, from plain black metal to sparkling glass… you’ll find it all here.

<div id="text">DARYAGANJ SUNDAY BOOK MARKET<br>

Known to have begun around 1964, the weekly book market at Old Delhi’s Daryaganj is said to be one of the oldest regular book markets of the city. The book market stretches westward from this point along Jawaharlal Nehru Marg (the southern border of Old Delhi) and northward on Bahadur Shah Jafar Road (which bisects Old Delhi from Darya Ganj).

The market is set on the narrow footpaths and cramped streets of Daryaganj only on Sundays. This market is practically a treasure for book lovers because of availability of second hand books in good shape and at reasonable prices, sometimes the prices dupe down so low that you can by a John Grisham at as low as 10-20 INR. Not only popular fiction but competitive entrance exam guides, text books and all kinds of magazines are also available here. Sometimes books are not properly arranged and you have to literally scrounge to strike the gold out of the pile but it’s worth all the effort and time since you get your little surprise at fairly cheap rates. While walking along the footpath I noticed my school text books lying around the corner and felt as if I have found some old friends of mine amidst the huge book stocks.

If you plan to visit this book market then it is advisable not to carry an ‘already prepared book list’ in your hand because if you are hell bent to buy only those books that are on your list then you wouldn’t be able to enjoy the surprises of this book market. The vendors have no clue about the authors or books. So it will be difficult for you to find exactly what you want. But on the other hand, it opens for you some uncertain doors to enter and dwell into. Carrying a rough list of Hemingway, Richard Bach and William Dalrymple in my pocket, I ended up with Edward Albert’s History of English Literature, Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin’s Three Cups of Tea, E.R.C. Davidar’s Whispers From The Wild, Syeda Hameed’s Beautiful Country in my satchel. Also among the books I ended up buying, was a small thin book of 60s classic Haikus by Basho, something that I read about in my creative writing classes, and was extremely joyous about buying that book in just 10 INR.

It’s not the books that you end up buying in this Sunday book market but a bunch of stories you wreath around this footpath while buying some stories and giving some to this place.

<br>Timings: 11am-6pm (open only on Sunday)
